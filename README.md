<h1 align="center">RockPile m51d25</h1>
<h3 align="center">First project using python pygame</h3>

<h3 align="left">Features:</h3>
<p align="left">A simple, self drawn GUI with onscreen tutorials and tips all accomplished in python pygame. ChatGPT was sparingly used for the ai algorythm function creation and implementation</p>

<h3 align="left">Game rules:</h3>
<p align="left">Each player takes turns taking 2 or 3 rocks from a predetermined rockpile, the user has the option of choosing the starting amount in the rockpile before each game start and has to input a number between 50 and 70. The user then picks the desired ai algorythm, then choose who has the first move and the game will commence. Each player gets +1 point for every rock taken from the rockpile as well as +2 points if the remaining numeric value in the rockpile is an even number, if the remaining value is an odd number, that player recieves -2 points. The game ends when there are no more rocks remaining in the rockpile. 0 is considered as a non even non odd number. The game can be reset at any point in the game by pressing the "R" key on your keyboard. Goodluck! and thankyou for trying :3</p>
